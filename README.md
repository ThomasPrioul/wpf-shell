WPF Shell Integration Library (Ex)tended Edition
===

This is a .Net library for providing custom chrome for WPF windows and some other deeper integration with
the Windows Shell.  It's a concrete implementation of techniques described here:

It's a fork of the original [WPF Shell Integration Library](http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/WPFShell),
which hasn't been updated in a while, and the download links for that are for older frameworks and the
source has some bugs that I've addressed since.  Some of this code has since been incorporated into the
current .Net framework, but this library gives the ability to use these features in older versions of the
framework, or more deeply extend the interop code to enable more features.
